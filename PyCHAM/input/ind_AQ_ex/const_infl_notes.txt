For a summer's day, windows assumed to be open at 7:00am (25200 s) and closed at 18:20 (66000 s).  Note that where possible both indoor and outdoor sources are accounted for, with the indoor source assumed constant (unless from an indoor activity) (ppb/s), but the outdoor one varying depending on whether windows open (and possibly if an outdoor diurnal cycle is known).

*****************************************

Please note, that taking into account that background ambient CO (carbon monoxide) concentrations are around 100-300 ppb (Table 1 of doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15969-2020), and that typical indoor concentrations are around 500 ppb (Figure 3 of doi.org/10.1080/23744731.2017.1372806), it appears most likely that when CO measurements are reported in the HOMEchem article https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f in ppb, they actually mean ppm (so ppb is an error).  Correcting for this error, the HOMEchem article https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f reports a mean indoor value of 400. ppb (0.4 ppm) in Table 6, and a mean outdoor concentration of 200. ppb (0.2 ppm) in the same table.  Emission source indoors is combustion.  Assuming equilibrium, the indoor contribution to CO is 400.-100.=300.ppb.  Windows were closed for the 400. ppb measurement, so the indoor emission rate must be 300.ppb*closed window dilution factor: 300.*1.2e-4=3.6e-2
The influx from outdoors must change when windows open (to balance the loss caused by increased dil_fac):  when windows closed: 100.ppb*1.2e-4 = 1.2e-2ppb/s, when windows open: 100.ppb*3.7e-4=3.7e-2ppb/s.  Therefore indoor+outdoor is 3.6e-2+1.2e-2=4.8e-2ppb/s when windows closed and 3.6e-2+3.7e-2=7.3e-2ppb/s when windows open.

CH4 (methane) has a mean indoor value of 1.9e3 ppb in Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f, and a mean outdoor value of 1.88e3 ppb in the same table.  So, it looks like the outdoor source dominates even when windows are closed.
Therefore, we assumed no indoor source and just allow the outdoor source to balance the dilution factor: windows closed: 1.9e3*1.2e-4 = 2.28e-1 ppb/s, windows open 1.9e3*3.7e-4 =  7.03e-1 ppb/s

APINENE has a summertime outdoor concentration of 0.4 ppb and a wintertime outdoor concentration of 0.04 ppb (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341470550_Emissions_and_atmospheric_concentrations_of_a-pinene_at_an_urban_site_of_India_Role_of_changes_in_meteorology (DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127071)).  Section 3.2 of UK study (DOI: 10.1039/D0EM00504E) says median annual value of alpha-pinene is 0.14 ppb (((0.8e-12/136.2)*si.N_A)/25034759936.935734).  The indoor concentration (ppb) is in Table 1 of Sarwar et al. (2002) (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9): 0.5 ppb.  But they note that the outdoor concentration of alpha-pinene is 0.04 ppb, so the indoor concentration without outdoor source is (0.50-0.04) = 0.46 ppb, and the indoor emission rate when windows closed is then 0.46ppb*1.2e-4/s = 5.52e-5.  To this must be added the summertime Bradford outdoor influx which is (for summertime) 0.4ppb*1.2e-4/s = 4.8e-5, so sum is 5.52e-5+4.8e-5 ppb/s = 1.032e-4 ppb/s when windows closed. And for windows open, the indoor emission rate stays the same, but influx from outdoors increases to (dil_fac = 3.7e-4 /s*0.4 (ppb outdoors)) = 1.48e-4 pp/s, which, when added to the indoor emission rate (5.52e-5) is then 2.032e-4

O3 (ozone) assumed to have no indoor surface source, but does have outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4496444&type=auto.  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (40 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor (0.2).  When windows open: daily maximum (80 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0)

NO (nitric oxide) has indoor source from NO2 deposition to surface (page 1483 of https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto), and has outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto.  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (0.3 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 3.6e-5 ppb/s.  When windows open: daily maximum (6 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 2.22e-3 ppb/s.  Although Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f (based on mean value) suggests an indoor source around 50 ppb of NO, Figure 4 of that publication shows the median value indoors is around 5 ppb and the median value outdoors is around 1 ppb, which gives an indoor source of 4 ppb when windows closed: 4.0*1.2e-4 = 4.8-4ppb/s.  Summing indoor and outdoor together gives 4.8e-4+3.6e-5=5.16e-4ppb/s when windows closed and 4.8e-4+2.22e-3=2.7e-3ppb/s when windows open

NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) does have outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto (results shown in brackets in next sentences).  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (10 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(0.72) = 8.64e-4 ppb/s.  When windows open: daily maximum (80 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 2.96e-2 ppb/s.  There is also an indoor source of 7-5 ppb=2ppb when windows closed in Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f, which gives an emission rate of 2ppb*dil_fac when windows closed = 2*1.2e-4 = 2.4e-4 ppb/s.  When summed with outdoor source we get: 2.4e-4+8.64e-4=1.104e-3 ppb/s when windows closed and 2.4e-4+2.96e-2=2.984e-2 ppb/s when windows open.

NO3 (nitrate radical) only produced indoors when ozone is high according to abtract of https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00415, but this level of ozone (40 ppb), not seen yet in simulations, so no indoor surface source considered.  At night, NO3 reaches 10s of ppt according to https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/4187/2010/acp-10-4187-2010.pdf, so allow ingress of this at night time: (0.01 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 1.e-2*1.2e-4*1.0=1.2e-6ppb/s at night and 0 ppb/s in the day.

HNO3 (nitric acid) will enter buildings when windows open, and the suggested outdoor concentration is 2 ppb (abstract of doi.org/10.1021/es026133x) and Figure 4 of https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1073161X.1993.10467221?needAccess=true, therefore HNO3 allowed to enter building at a rate of 2ppb*dil_fac when windows open.  Both references above indicate that indoor concentrations of HNO3 are negligible unless a source such as an unvented convective space heater (which are now rare and possibly illegal to sell) is operating.  When windows and doors are closed, penetration factor of HNO3 is suggested to be sufficiently low to make HNO3 penetration from outdoors effectively negligible (doi.org/10.1021/es026133x).  Note that HNO3 concentrations are not measured at Leeds Headingley Kerbside.

HONO (nitrous acid) is suggested to be produced from NO2 reaction on wall, with 2 NO2 needed to make 1 HONO (page 1483 of https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1073161X.1993.10467221?needAccess=true and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297).  This is one suggested reason that indoor HONO is observed to be higher than outdoor HONO in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297.  Using results from summertime in urban Beijing in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297, outdoor HONO concentration averages 0.72 ppb and indoor HONO concentration averages 7.10.  So constant indoor emission is (7.10-0.72)ppb*1.2e-4/s = 7.656e-4 ppb/s and the outdoor flux in when windows closed is: 0.72*1.2e-4/s = 8.64e-5, so total flux when windows closed is: 7.656e-4+8.64e-5 and total flux when windows open is: 7.656e-4+0.72*3.7e-4 ppb/s

N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide) is generated at night outside at concentrations around 100 ppt according to https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/4187/2010/acp-10-4187-2010.pdf, however it is known to undergo heterogenous reaction to HNO3 (https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/4929/2011/acp-11-4929-2011.pdf).  Therefore, its infiltration factor seems likely to be zero.  And during the day outdoor concentrations are negligible.  Given that N2O5 forms HNO3 on surfaces, it seems unlikely it will be directly emitted from surfaces indoors.  Therefore, emission is set to zero, and any N2O5 is produced only from gas-phase chemistry (NO2+NO3 = N2O5)

H2O is set to maintain a relative humidity of 50 % when windows closed and 50 % when windows open (note that temperature is maintained at 20 oC).  But note that a drop in RH at the onset of the simulation will occur if walls are sufficiently large that they absorb a noticable mass of water.

SO2 is higher outdoors than indoors in table 1 of Sarwar et al. 2002 (doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9).  The indoor to outdoor ratio when windows closed is 1:4.6, therefore the penetration factor is 1/4.6 = 0.217, so emission rate when windows closed is: 4.6*1.2e-4*0.217 = 1.2e-4 and when windows open: 4.6*3.7e-4*1.=1.7e-3


*****influxes based on indoor+outdoor measurements by Sarwar et al. 2002 and Zhu et al. 2013*****

Benzene is 2x higher indoors than outdoors in table 1 of Sarwar et al. 2002 (doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9).  Therefore a substantial outdoor source is possible.  No penetration factor could be found for benzene.  Therefore, I assume a penetration factor of 1.  When windows closed 2.5ppb*1.2e-4/s=3.e-4 ppb/s enters from outside.  When windows open 2.5ppb*3.7e-4/s=9.25e-4 ppb/s enters from outside.  In addition, 2.5 ppb comes from the inside (5ppb total indoor concentration when windows closed-2.5ppb of this from outdoor concentration=2.5ppb originating from the indoors).  So there is a constant indoor emission of  2.5ppb*1.2e-4/s=3.e-4ppb/s.  When windows closed, in total there is 6e=4 ppb/s (indoor+outdoor source), when windows open, in total there is 1.225e-3 ppb/s (indoor+outdoor source).

m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene follow the same method as benzene above

Components, C2H6 to TBUTOL (except for benzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene which had at least 1/2 of the indoor concentration value for the outdoor concentration value), listed in the lit_source sheet of the const_infl.xlsx workbook are all assumed to originate from the indoors, so their emission rate is constant, even when ventilation changes, which will mean concentrations tend to go down when ventilation increases, since the loss rate will be the same.  Their emission rate is then calculated to give the literature value for indoor concentration at equilibrium when windows are closed (literature indoor concentration (ppb)*dil_fac(/s) (when windows closed)).

For ethanol, an additional source is added during showering, following Yeoman et al. (2021)(doi.org/10.1111/ina.12811), which is detailed below in the Yeoman section

DCBENE (dichlorobenzene is provided by Sarwar and is present in MCM, but has no reactions in MCM, so is excluded from simulation)

*****influx based on components measured under background conditions unique to Arata et al. (2021) (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12906) (see further down this document for emissions during activities)*****

Acetic acid measured background mixing ratio was multiplied by the dilution factor (56.ppb*1.2e-4=6.72e-3 ppb/s) when windows were closed (as windows were closed during measurement), and this value kept for when windows open, since indoor emission dominates over influx from outdoors, so window opening should dilute.

Methanol is also supplied in Sarwar.  The emission rate in Arata is 4x more than in Sarwar, but perhaps this is due to differences in how new bits of the house are.  Stick with the rate from Sarwar.

Formic acid method the same as for acetic acid mentioned above.

Ethanol also supplied by Sarwar and emission rates very similar to Arata.

The C9 saturated carbonyl (e.g. nonanal), is not available in MCM, as realised when other publications identified nonanal emission.

D5, a.k.a. decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, is not included in MCM, as realised when other publications identified emission.

2-propanol is around 2.5x less is Sarwar but we stick with the Sarwar value.

Acetaldehyde emission rate is almost exactly the same as reported in Sarwar, so stick with the Sarwar value.

Acetone emission rate in Sarwar is 3x that in Arata.  However, the Sarwar source is from measurements in an office, whereas Arata is a home, so going with the Arata emission rate.

Furfural is not in MCM.

The background monoterpene in Arata et al. is very similar to the alpha-pinene from Sarwar, so the alpha-pinene is kept the same as from Sarwar.

Hexanoic acid is not in MCM

Pentanol is 7x higher emission rate in Arata than in Zhu et al. 2013.  Neither publication discusses its source, so sticking with Zhu as their measurements were from homes that have been lived in.

*****influx due to ozone reaction on surfaces*****

Note that the influx of hexanal due to O3 reaction on wall, which is quantified in Kruza et al. (2017), doi.org/10.1111/ina.12381, is assumed to be included in the measurements reported by Sarwar et al. 2002 and Zhu et al. 2013, since they would not have been able to prevent O3 deposition and consequent production of these VOCs during their indoor measurements.

The influx of heptanal (which is not reported by Sarwar or Zhu) is based on the simulated rate of ozone deposition to the wall multiplied by the yield given in Table 1 of Kruza et al. (2017) (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12381).  Using the quick_chem_scheme and both the 'windows closed' and 'windows open' influx of O3, we see 8.4 ug/m3 ('windows closed') and  ('windows open') of ozone deposited to the wall in 2 hours.  Using multiple for converting ppb to # molecules/cm3 (25034759936.935734 ppb/(#molecules/cm3)), this works out, for 'windows closed' to a rate of 5.8e-4 ppb/s of O3 loss to wall ((8.4/7.2e3)*1.e-12/(48.)*6.022e23/25034759936.935734), and for 'windows open' to a rate of 1.1e-3 ((15.19/7.2e3)*1.e-12/(48.)*6.022e23/25034759936.935734).  The yield for heptanal from ozone deposition to surfaces is 0.01 in Table 1 of Kruza et al. (2017), so the rate of emission due to ozone deposition to wall is 5.8e-4 ppb/s*0.01=5.8e-6 ppb/s for 'windows closed' and 1.1e-3 ppb/s*0.01=1.1e-5 ppb/s for 'windows open'.

The influx of 4-oxopentanal (which is not reported by Sarwar or Zhu) is based on the simulated rate of ozone deposition to the wall multiplied by the yield given in Table 1 of Kruza et al. (2017) (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12381).  Using the quick_chem_scheme and both the 'windows closed' and 'windows open' influx of O3, we see 8.4 ug/m3 ('windows closed') and 15.19 ug/m3 ('windows open') of ozone deposited to the wall in 2 hours.  Using multiple for converting ppb to # molecules/cm3 (25034759936.935734 ppb/(#molecules/cm3)), this works out, for 'windows closed' to a rate of 5.8e-4 ppb/s of O3 loss to wall ((8.4/7.2e3)*1.e-12/(48.)*6.022e23/25034759936.935734), and for 'windows open' to a rate of 1.1e-3 ((15.19/7.2e3)*1.e-12/(48.)*6.022e23/25034759936.935734).  The yield for 4-oxopentanal from ozone deposition to surfaces is 0.026 in Table 1 of Kruza et al. (2017), so the rate of emission due to ozone deposition to wall is 5.8e-4 ppb/s*0.026=1.508e-5 ppb/s for 'windows closed' and 1.1e-3 ppb/s*0.026=1.1e-5 ppb/s for 'windows open'.


*****influx due to showering*****
Yeoman et al. 2021 (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12811) report showering emissions for limonene, benzyl alcohol and ethanol

In the PyCHAM setup we assume the shower lasts 10 minutes (600s), so here I divide the total emission reported by Yeoman et al. (2021) by 600s to get the emission rate.

Yeoman et al. (2021) abstracts says limonene emission is 1.77mg, to convert this to ppb/s, first assume that this mass is spread over the entire volume of the house (1.77e-3g/500cm*500cm*500cm=1.25e8cm3=1.416e-11g/cm3) (conversion from total emitted (g) to ppb/s is: ((1.77e-3/(500.**3.))/6.e2)/136.238*6.022e23/2.5e10=4.17e-3ppb/s

As calculated for limonene in line above, the emission rate for benzyl alcohol is 3.2e-3 ppb/s (((1.07e-3/(500.**3.))/6.e2)/108.1378*6.022e23/2.5e10)

As calculated for limonene two lines above, the emission rate for ethanol during showering is 2.3e-3 ppb/s (((0.33e-3/(500.**3.))/6.e2)/46.0684*6.022e23/2.5e10), which must be added to the baseline ethanol emission from Sarwar et al. (2002)

*****influx due to cooking*****
Table 4 of Arata et al. (2021) (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12906) gives emissions during cooking.

Ethanol has a total emission mass concentration of 67.0 ug.  Which we convert to ppb/s using the volume of the home (235e6 cm3, the #molecules/cm3 to ppb conversion factor (25034759936.935734 ppb/(# molecules/cm3)) and the time the cooking occurred over (20*60 s): (67*1.e-3/235.e6)/46.07*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(20*60) during cooking.  To this, we add the background emission: 1.2e-2+(67.*1.e-3/235.e6)/46.07*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(20.*60.)

Butanal released during cooking converted to ppb/s using same method as ethanol above: 0.+(0.53*1.e-3/235.e6)/72.11*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(20.*60.)

Isoprene released during cooking converted to ppb/s using same method as ethanol above: 2.4e-4+(0.35*1.e-3/235.e6)/68.12*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(20.*60.)

Note that citral is not in the MCM

*****influx due to cleaning with bleach*****
Table 2 of Arata et al. (2021) (doi.org/10.1111/ina.12906) gives emissions during bleach cleaninig.  Note that the chloroamines and cyanogen chloride are not available in MCM.  

Methanol has a the total emission mass concentration is 1.06 ug.  Which we convert to ppb/s using the volume of the home (235e6 cm3, the #molecules/cm3 to ppb conversion factor (25034759936.935734 ppb/(# molecules/cm3)) and the time the cleaning occurred over (15*60 s): (1.06*1.e-3/235.e6)/32.0419*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(15*60)=3.8e-3ppb/s during cleaning.  To this, we add the background emission of 5.0e-3 = 3.5e-3

Acetaldehyde released during cleaning converted to ppb/s using same method as methanol above: (1.04*1.e-3/235.e6)/44.05*6.022e23/25034759936.935734/(15*60)+6.e-4
