# model variable file for reproducing the JPAC alpha-pinene SOA observations given in 
# Ehn et al. 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13032) (fig 2b), Roldin et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8) (fig 2a). Inputs are derived from 
# several sources: Rate of movement to/from wall 
# (the gas-wall mass transfer coefficient) is given by Eq. 1 of Methods section of Roldin et al. # 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8), as is the effective absorbing 
# mass concentration of wall (5umol/m3 = 5 umol/m3*200g/mol = 1e3ug/m3 = 1e-3g/m3), 
# noting that PyCHAM assumes a molar mass of the wall of 200 g/mol
# Fig 2as of Roldin et al. 2019 shows the measured ammonium sulphate (note a mistake has been
# made in their legend, meaning that measured ammonium sulphate is the red cross), which was 
# used to tune pconc and pconct here. Ehn et al. 2014 (doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8) 
# say in their main text that the experiment is steady-state ozonolysis and that seed particles 
# have 100 nm diameter (mean_rad below). In the 'Online Methods' of Ehn et al. 2014, they say
# residence time in JPAC is 45 minutes (dil_fac below), they also give T and RH. Extended 
# Data Figure 6 of Ehn et al. 2014 says that steady-state concentration of alpha-pinene was 
# 19 ppb and for ozone was 83 ppb. Values for NO, NO2, SO2 and CO were assumed to be the same
# as the values used in Pichelstorfer et al. 2024 (doi.org/10.1039/D4EA00054D) 
# (supplementery material ST5). Online Methods section of Ehn et al. 2014 implies that the
# discharge lamps and UV lamps were used, with the potential for shielding the UV lamps.
# They don't say what the shielding on the UV lamps is, but in extended data fig 6 they say that 
# 9/15 of alpha-pinene reacts with O3 and 6/15 of alpha-pinene reacts with OH, so
# they can be used (by tracking the alpha-pinene change tendency) to tune the UV transmission
# factor. However, it was found that the 9/15 ration was achieved using an OH background
# reactivity (contained in chemical scheme) comparable to that given in Baker et al. 2024 when
# zero UVC light was allowd in.
# Note that the SMILES for PRAM species that are present in the xml file were made
# using PRAM_SMILES_generator.py, which uses the functional group information from 
# Supplementary Table 2, which can be downloaded from 
# https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.905102?format=html#download, and additionally, an [O]O
# functional group for PRAM peroxy radicals
# note that in section Methods/Smog chamber simulations of Roldin et al. 2019, they say that
# PRAM RO2, closed-shell monomers and closed-shell accretion products that are 
# HOM (oxygen number >6)
# were assumed to deposit irreversibly on the JPAC chamber walls, so only these components
# are given a wall vapour pressure of zero in vol_Comp below.
# Roldin2019paper/Methods/ADCHAM and ADCHEM model setup and description' says only 
# components with vapour pressures less than 10^-2 Pa were allowed to condense onto 
# particles, so this used to set partit_cutoff below
# In the first 3 hours of the Ehn experiment, before the ammonium sulphate seed is added,
# there is around 1 ug/m3 of SOA measured, which
# I think is derived from nucleation. So pconc below represents this. However, if gas-phase
# components are allowed to undergo unhindered partitioning to these small particles (despite
# their high kelvin number), the SOA goes too high and the PRAMcsacc gas-phase abundance 
# (comparing against Fig. 2d in Roldin) goes too low. So a radius-dependent accommodation
# coefficient (accom_coeff_user) is set to slow condensation to these small particles.
# Ehn et al. 2014 say that ammonium sulphate seed particles are dried before entering chamber,
# therefore below we say they are on the efflorescence curve (the DRH of 
# pure ammonium sulphate is 80 % (https://doi.org/10.1029/2002GL014733)), and therefore do not 
# allow water partitioning at the RH here. 
# The seed dissociation constant for ammonium sulphate is tuned to give SOA
# agreement with Roldin simulations, since ADCHEM had an unkown estimation of ammonium sulphate
# dissociation
