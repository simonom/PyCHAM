# model variable file for reproducing the JPAC alpha-pinene SOA observations given in 
# Ehn et al. 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13032) (fig 2b), Roldin et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8) (fig 2a). Inputs are derived from 
# several sources: Rate of movement to/from wall 
#(the gas-wall mass transfer coefficient) is given by Eq. 1 of Methods section of Roldin et al. #2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8), as is the effective absorbing mass #concentration of wall (5umol/m3 = 5 umol/m3*200g/mol = 1e3ug/m3 = 1e-3g/m3), noting that PyCHAM #assumes a molar mass of the wall of 200 g/mol
# Fig 2as of Roldin et al. 2019 shows the measured ammonium sulphate (note a mistake has been
# made in their legend, meaning that measured ammonium sulphate is the red cross), which was 
# used to tune pconc and pconct here. Ehn et al. 2014 (doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8) 
# say in their main text that the experiment is steady-state ozonolysis and that seed particles 
# have 100 nm diameter (mean_rad below). In the 'Online Methods' of Ehn et al. 2014, they say
# residence time in JPAC is 45 minutes (dil_fac below), they also give T and RH. Extended 
# Data Figure 6 of Ehn et al. 2014 says that steady-state concentration of alpha-pinene was 
# 19 ppb and for ozone was 83 ppb. Values for NO, NO2, SO2 and CO were assumed to be the same
# as the values used in Pichelstorfer et al. 2024 (doi.org/10.1039/D4EA00054D) 
# (supplementery material ST5). Online Methods section of Ehn et al. 2014 implies that the
# discharge lamps and UV lamps were used, with the potential for shielding the UV lamps.
# They don't say what the shielding on the UV lamps is, but in extended data fig 6 they say that 
# 9/15 of alpha-pinene reacts with O3 and 6/15 of alpha-pinene reacts with OH, so
# they can be used (by tracking the alpha-pinene change tendency) to tune the UV transmission
# factor. Note that the SMILES for PRAM species that are present in the xml file were made
# using PRAM_SMILES_generator.py, which uses the functional group information from 
# Supplementary Table 2, which can be downloaded from 
# https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.905102?format=html#download, and additionally, an [O]O
# functional group for PRAM peroxy radicals
# note that in section Methods/Smog chamber simulations of Roldin et al. 2019, they say that HOM
# peroxy radicals were assumed to deposit irreversibly on the JPAC chamber walls. But when MCM
# RO2 are allowed to reversibly partition with the walls, PyCHAM-estimated SOA comes out higher
# than Roldin estimated SOA (when both use SIMPOL for nonHOMs and HOMs components). Later on
# in the same paragraph Roldin et al. 2019 say 'the release of semi-volatile non-reactive VOC 
# back to the gas-phase from the walls ...', implying that MCM RO2 are lost to chamber wall
# irreversibly, and when PyCHAM sets vapour pressures of all RO2 (as well as all HOMs) on the
# chamber wall to zero, then agreement is gained with ADCHAM
# 'Roldin2019paper/Methods/ADCHAM and ADCHEM model setup and description' says only 
# components with vapour pressures less than 10^-2 Pa were allowed to condense onto 
# particles, so this used to set partit_cutoff below
