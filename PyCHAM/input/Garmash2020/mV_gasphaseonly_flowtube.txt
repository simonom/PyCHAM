# model variable file for reproducing the JPAC Benzene SOA observations given in figure 6 of 
# Garmash et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-515-2020). Inputs are derived from 
# several sources: Pichelstorfer et al. 2024 (doi.org/10.1039/D4EA00054D) supplementary material  #Table ST5 gives total simulation time, RH, T, mixing ratios of benzene, O3, NO, NO2, SO2, CO, #seed addition time, diameter of seed, standard deviation of seed, and caption of this table #gives mean residence time, whilst fig S18 shows very clearly that the measured SOA is 2.75 ug/#m3 at its peak. Pichelstorfer et al. 2024 (doi.org/10.1039/D4EA00054D) main article (section #2.6.2) says to assume that components with vapour pressures <1e-7 Pa cannot evaporate from wall #and section 3.2 says that experiments was under UV radiation 
# (backed up by section 3.1.2 of Garmash et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-515-2020)). 
# Rate of movement to/from wall (the gas-wall mass transfer coefficient) is given by Eq. 1 of
# Methods section of Roldin et al. #2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12338-8), as is the effective absorbing mass #concentration of wall (5umol/m3 = 5 umol/m3*200g/mol = 1e3ug/m3 = 1e-3g/m3), noting that PyCHAM #assumes a molar mass of the wall of 200 g/mol. At the bottom of Table 1 of Garmash et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-515-2020) is the aerosol seed experiment description, showing the J(O1D) value, which was used to tune the tf_UVC value here, the OH concentration, which was used to tune the OH background reactivity in the chemical scheme file, Fig 6 of Garmash shows the mass concentration of ammonium sulphate (seed particle), which was used to tune pconc here
# note that using EVAPORATION for both HOMs and nonHOMs we can get a direct comparison with the
# results of Pichelstorfer et al. 2024. And PyCHAM gets closer to their results when seed_diss = 
# 0.000001 rather than seed_diss = 1. (at which value PyCHAM SOA goes higher than in 
#Pichelstorfer et al. 2024)
