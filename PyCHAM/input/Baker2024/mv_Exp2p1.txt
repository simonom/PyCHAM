# the main article of Baker et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4789-2024), Table1,
# they say that surface area of seed particles was 8.7e-4 m2/m3 in this experiment, 
# which is used to set pconc below
# and checked with the Seed Only option on the Particle surface area button on the 
# PyCHAM/Plot/Particle GUI
# although some notes on wall interaction are included, below, I strongly believe that the SOA
# results reported in Figure S3 of Baker supplementary material are corrected for gas and 
# particle loss to wall, because the main Baker article says these were corrected for when
# estimating the SOA yield. And they report a yield of 10 % for low HO2/RO2 in exp2.1, for
# which 3.4 ug/m3 of SOA is reported in Figure S3. And Table 1 of the main paper indicates that
# around 6 ppb of alpha-pinene is consumed in this experiment, which has a conversion factor of
# 5.7 ug/m3/ppb under the T and P of the experiment. 6ppb*5.7 ug/m3/ppb gives 34.2 ug/m3 of
# consumed alpha-pinene, which is set as the denominator in the yield calculation, whilst
# 3.4 ug/m3 of SOA is set as the numerator, to give a wall-corrected yield of 10 %. Hence,
# the reported SOA is consistent with the SOA that must have been used in the reported
# wall-corrected SOA yield calculation.
# mass transfer coefficients of components to wall are from section S3 of Baker's supplementary
# material (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4789-2024-supplement), note that the reference
# value of 0.0058 is from 1./171., as 171 s is the lifetime due to wall loss observed for C10
# components in S3 of Baker's supplementary material
# the rate of particle loss to wall is from section S2 of Baker's supplementary material
# followed by: Need to calculate knowing that lifetime of particles is 54 minutes when 
# residence time was 63 minutes:
# Particle loss rate (fraction of total particles/s) = 1/Ï„  =1/k_wall +1/k_(flush out)  
# so 1/(54*60) = 1/kwall+1/(63*60) so 1/kwall = 1/(54*60)-1/(63*60) = 4.41e-5 /s
