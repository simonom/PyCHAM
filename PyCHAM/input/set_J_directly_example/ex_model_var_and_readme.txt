# In this example, the user has set the photolysis 
# rates (J) explicitly, i.e. they do not need to be 
# calculated from actinic fluxes combined with
# absorption cross-sections and quantum yields,
# nor from the Hayman approach for solar
# radiation provided in photolysisRates.py
# note that to set this simulaion up, 
# light_status has been set to the path of the
# file containing the photolysis rates. These example
# photolysis rates are from spectral analysis of
# Manchester Aerosol Chamber lights, combined
# with the Mainz database. The photolysis rates
# file contains a change of photolysis with time,
# starting with the full intensity of lights,
# followed by a change to half intensity after
# 1800 seconds (half an hour). The change can 
# be demonstrated in PyCHAM by first selecting
# this example simulation and then asking to
# display photolysis rates using the 
# 'Check Values' button of the 'Simulate' tab
# and selecting 'Photolysis Rates' from the drop-
# down options. In addition, one can see the
# effect on the component O3, which is
# photolysed in this simulation, by running the 
# simulation and then selecting the 'Plot' tab
# followed by the 'Flux' tab followed by writing
# O3 into the text bar and selecting 'Plot change 
# tendency due to each chemical reaction', which
# demonstrates the reduction in O3 loss through
# the photolysis channel from 0.5 hours onwards
