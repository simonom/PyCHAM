'''module to solve coagulation through integration'''
# Using the differential equation for coagulation given in Eq. 15.2
# of Jacobson (2005), the new number size distribution is solved.  
# The volume-conserving result is found using Eq. 15.2 of Jacobson (2005) to
# estimate the number fraction per size bin contributing to/being lost from size
# bins to estimate the molecular concentration being exchanged
# Because the coagulation kernel is a constant for integration but is size-dependent
# and coagulation changes particle sizes, this is one source of imprecision that is
# reduced by having a high ratio of number of size bins to total particle size range.
# Another source of imprecision is the assumption that coagulation pairs have
# the same volume throughout the integration.  This flaw is highlighted when
# considering an initial number size distribution of all particles in one size bin.  If the
# size bin is sufficiently wide self-coagulation will produce larger particles in the 
# same size bin.  Eventually self-coagulation produces particles in a larger size bin
# but this is not recognised as the initial volumes of particles inform the size
# of coagulated particles.  This problem is minimised through increasing ratio of
# size bin number to total size range and through reducing time interval.  This problem
# is entirely removed if a monomer size distribution (Fig. 15.1 Jacobson 2005) is 
# present.
# The final source of imprecision for the volume-conserving method is that the number
# concentration of particles is not conserved, therefore number concentration is
# estimated assuming the particles in each size bin have the same volume per 
# particle as the volume per particle before the integration.
# All the above sources of imprecision are removed when a monomer size distribution
# of particles is present.  However, if this requires interpolation/extrapolation, then
# imprecision may be introduced through smoothing of particle composition (component
# particle-phase concentrations).  The monomer size distribution is not included here 
# because on a desktop computer (as at 2021), the computation time is prohibitively
# high when the size range of particles is within that expected for use with PyCHAM.
# For example, a radius range of three orders of magnitude would require a trillion
# size bins with a monomer volume size distribution.
